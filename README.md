# cutieCleanUp
Cutie Clean up is a minigame in which players will scavenge along a map and pick up trash in the ocean. This game was aimed to teach elementary schoolers good sustainable practices. When a player has picked up a piece of trash a unique message pops up on the user's screen about ways they live sustainably. This game was submitted to UCR's begginer friendly hackathon, CutieHack.
